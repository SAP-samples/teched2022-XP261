# Exercise 3 - Setup Notification Management

To receive emails from SAP Cloud ALM in case of an alert, you first must register your user in Notification Management and confirm that you want to receive emails. Usually, you will receive an email when your user is added to SAP Cloud ALM, and you can verify your email address in this invitation email.
In this section, you will learn how to add an email for a user manually or add a distribution list email as a notification recipient in SAP Cloud ALM. 

Please note: Entering your email address is not mandatory to finish the exercise, but you will not receive an email alert notification from SAP Cloud ALM. We will remove all email recipients from Notification Management after this session.
